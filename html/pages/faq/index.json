The session selection team will then pick from the highest rated sessions to build a rounded schedule that provides enough sessions for each track.  After the sessions have been selected, we will review the session speakers to try to ensure that we give community members the most opportunities to present."

The session selection team will review all submitted trainings and select topics that meet our community’s needs as well as being taught by a skilled presenter.  If we see similar trainings being proposed by multiple people, we may approach these community members to see if they are willing to work together to provide a single training session."

There is a MARTA stop located within walking distance from the hotel that should take approximately 35 minutes to take.  Simply take the gold line from the airport to Lenox station.  Exit the station and travel 0.2mi north along Lenox Rd NE to the hotel."

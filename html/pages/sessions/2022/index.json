In this session we'll look at what it means to be a developer, how to take that first step and how to get your development to stick and grow.  We'll talk about how developing outside of Salesforce can help you learn how to develop inside of Salesforce.  Even if you never write code, learning about development can help you grow your career and help you understand when developers on your team discuss issues they are facing.  By the end of the session, you should have an idea for at least one development project you can start right away and the tools to understand where to start.</p>",

The transition to flow is demonstrated through the familiar process builder layout, allowing those newer to the tool to have the confidence they can use their existing skills to champion flow.</p><p>The session will establish rules for creating a flow framework that works in large, complex environments beginning with naming conventions that are standardized to provide easy Flow List View creation, mirror development terms (Trigger, Classes), and allow for easy componentization and reusability of flows.  The focus shifts to how the 'one process per object' rule works with Flow Triggers; setting guidelines for how to keep control of your order of execution while managing increasingly complex automation needs.</p><p>The design pattern itself demonstrates how Flow Triggers, Flow 'Trigger Handles', and Flow 'Classes' work together to create an all encompassing approach to flow that is highly flexible, modular, and scalable.

In this presentation we will go over dark deployment strategies, such as using \"natural\" barriers / switches such as Record Type, permission sets, or other differentiators for a feature, as well as using custom metadata or labels. We use dark deployment strategies to separate the release of code from feature go-live, enabling roll back to original functionality through a change of a label, or enabling the gradual roll out of new features to subsets of users.</p><p>We've dealt with some unique DevOps challenges due to the complexity and size of our Salesforce organization.

This increase in collaboration has resulted in a change in expectations and behaviors as well. The “new normal” is that customers can have their Customer Support issues resolved and questions answered without physical contact, through live virtual interactions with the businesses they work with.</p><p>The composition of the workforce has also changed: employees expect simple to use, low-friction technologies that allow them to interface with their clients and team members remotely, independent of where they are geographically located.</p><p>Unfortunately, the benefits of numerous collaboration tools are often displaced by being disparate and siloed systems. While improving one group's ability to work, it may further separate their work from the larger enterprise.
